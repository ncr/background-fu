BackgroundFu
============

Background tasks made dead simple.
Any resemblance to ActiveRecord is purely coincidental.

Five things:

1. If you have more than one Mongrel in your setup AND you want to be able to 
  retrieve progress of a job or have the ability to stop it, you have to make 
  your sessions "sticky". This will cause your browser to always hit the same 
  mongrel (threads are tied to a Mongrel process). HAProxy can do that for you.

2. One, single Ruby thread can block your entire process if it blocks
   (dns queries, etc.). Keep that in mind.

3. You don't have to remember to set allow_concurrency, BackgroundFu does that.

4. You don't have to worry about stale database connections left after
   finished threads. BackgroundFu closes them.

5. In development mode, your code is reloaded on every request and the effect
 is that threads get messed. Set config.cache_classes = true in your environment
 (just like in production mode) to make your threads last longer than request.
 This makes development a little incoveniet, but it works.


Example
=======

In lib/hard_worker.rb (or anywhere else):

class HardWorker

  def download_internets(options = {})
    @progress = 0

    sniff_the_tubes(options)
    @progress = 20

    internets = pull_the_tubes(options)
    @progress = 100

    internets
  end
  
  def sniff_the_tubes(options)
    sleep(10)
  end
  
  def pull_the_tubes(options)
    sleep(10)
    
    "porn"
  end

end


In a controller:

  def create
    session[:job_id] = Background.jobs.create(HardWorker, :download_internets, params[:options]).id
  end

  def show
    @job      = Background.jobs.find(session[:job_id])
    @progress = @job.progress
    @result   = @job.result if @job.finished?
  end
  
  def index
    @jobs = Background.jobs
  end
  
  def destroy
    id = session[:job_id]
    Background.jobs.find(id).destroy
  end
  
Enjoy!
